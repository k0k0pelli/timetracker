# TimeTracker
TimeTracker is a simple tool for the personal tracking of the time you have spent on projects. It aims primarily at
developers who want to simply track their own effort spent on projects, but may be useful also in other cases
in which a detailed tracking of time spent is helpful. Hence, TimeTracker allowes you to

1. ... simply record your activities in a project on a personal basis (no multi-user TimeTracking).
1. ... create reports for the time spent on a project/phase/task on a daily basis.

TimeTracker is written in Java using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) and [Vaadin (Flow)](https://vaadin.com/). 
The reporting system uses [JasperReports]()


# Compile the Project and Startup
## Clone from git
```shell script
git clone https://github.com/k0k0pelli/timetracker.git
```

## Compiling with Gradle
The project is configured to use Gradle wrapper for compiling creating the distribution package of the Project.

Change to the directory where you cloned the GIT repo and execute Gradle
```shell script
cd git/timetracker
./gradlew clean bootJar
```
You will find find the package Spring Boot jar file in the target folder in the 
subdirectory `target/timetracking-X.Y-SNAPSHOT.jar`, with X.Y denoting the release version.

## Execute the TimeTracking application
The TimeTracking application is a web application. In order to execute it, 
copy the jar file to a directory of your choice and execute

```shell script
java -jar ./timetracking-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The server will startup on port 8080 @ localhost. The database is automatically created 
inside the startup directory and named `timetracker.mv.db`. So, you need to backup this file.

### Tweaking Parameters
The following default values are set in the 
Parameters that may be of interest to tweak with:

Parameter name | Description | Default value
-------------- | ----------- | -------------
spring.datasource.url | The URL to the `h2` database. This may be set to a database file in a different location, e.g. `jdbc:h2:/home/username/db/mydb` | jdbc:h2:./timetracker
server.port | The server port where the web application is reachable on localhost. | 8080
id.meier.time.tracker.locale.lang | This parameter may be used to override the _language_ locale, which is by default defined by your operating system. | &lt; operating system value &gt;
id.meier.time.tracker.locale.country | This parameter may be used to override the _country_ locale, which is by default defined by your operating system. | &lt; operating system Value &gt;
spring.security.user.name | The name of the user which is allowed to use TimeTracker (Enabling authentication, see next section). | user
spring.security.user.password |  The passwpord of the user which is allowed to use TimeTracker (Enabling authentication, see next section). | password

You may override properties defined for the application in the command line. See
the following [Stackoverflow entry](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37052857/spring-overriding-one-application-property-from-command-line).

### Protecting your TimeTracker Data
TimeTracker is intended for the personal use on the computer where it is installed. By default, there are no security
mechanisms switched on protecting your data. Thus, it is recommendable that the TimeTracker web application is only 
accessible from your local machine, which can be achieved by defining the necessary Firewall rules on your operating 
system (please check Google for how to to it).

Nevertheless, there may be cases in which you like to access TimeTracker from different devices. In this case, you can 
activate an authentication mechanism and define the credentials for the user which is allowed to sing-in. If you like to 
startup TimeTracker with authentication enbled, use the following command.

### Examples for Starting up TimeTracker

```shell script
java -Dspring.profiles.active=authenticated -jar ./timetracking-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

In this case, the user must authenticate with the default user and password which are actually `user` and `password`.
It is recommended to change the credentials with the following startup command:

```shell script
java -Dspring.profiles.active=authenticated -jar ./timetracking-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.security.user.name=<username> --spring.security.user.password=<password>
```

Substitute `<username>` and `<password>` with your own values.

With enabled authentication, a login dialog appears, when opening the URL of the TimeTracker for the first time:

# Small user guide
This section contains a brief user guide for TimeTracker.

## Data structure Stored by TimeTracker
The time tracking data of TimeTracker is structured in projects, phases, tasks, assignments.
A project consists of several phases, a phase in turn consists of several tasks. Each assignment is
the workload directly processed by you and may be associated with a project, phase, and task.

## Main Menu
The main menu of TimeTracker contains three entries:

* Manage Assignments: This part of the application allows the user to manage the assignments.
* Manage Projects: This part of the application provides an editor for managing projects, phases, and tasks.
* Time Reports: The reporting allows the user to report on the time spent on each project/phase/task, as well as
on a single day. Furthermore, it is possible to create reports on working time blocks.

## Managing Assignments
The following screenshot gives an overview of the assignment management view.

![Assignment View of TimeTracker](./docs/AssingmentsEditor.png "Assignment View of TimeTracker")

The Assignment View consists of three parts: 
- The options for creating a new assignment. 
- The search part on the upper half of the view.
- The assignment editor on the lower half of the view. 

The screenshot enumerates all the UI elements in the parts:

1.  Options for the creation of a new assignment
    1. `Guess Data of new Assignment` when creating a new Assignment, TimeTracker will 
       search for the project, phase and task that are set the most. These project, phase, and taks are
       set for the new Assignment.
    1.  `Create Assignment by template` when creating a new Assignment, TimeTracker will look for an existing Assignment that is 
       marked with the template name specified in (2). If an assignment is found, project, phase, task, and comment is taken over
       from the existing assignment.   
1. Name of the template used to fill out the new Assignment this is the name which is associated with an 
   existing Assignment. If the option `Create Assignment by template` is set, the project, phase, task and comment
   is taken over from the found Assignment template.
1. `Terminate non finished Assignments` if a new Assignment is saved, any open Assignment which has no end date and time 
   set will be terminated. That means that the current date and time is set as end date and time.
1. `New Assignment` button creates a new Assignment and fills out the data according to the chosen 
   options under (1) - (3). The Assignment editor appears with the new Assignment in the lower half of the view, see items
   (12) - (23). The new Assignment is not saved, but must be saved explicitely. 
1. Selection filter `Start Date`, `Start Time`, `End Date`, `End Time` Any values set in these 
   fields are used to search for Assignments whose start date/time and end date/time include the given
   start and end date/time. 
1. Reset selection date with `Set Filter for today` this button resets the start date/time and end date/time fields 
   for the selection of the Assignments. After resetting, the search date and time for the current day are set.
1. Selection filter for `Project`, `Phase`, and `Task` you may select Assignments which have 
   the selected Project, Phase, and Task set.
1. `Search button` the search button searches the Assignments that match with the given criteria. 
   The results are listed in the result table below. 
1. `Result panel` the result panel shows all found Assignments.
1. `Summary of the found results` the summary of the result list shows the number of Assignments found, 
   as well as the summed up number of hours spent.
1. `Export Results to CSV` this button exports all Assignments shown in the result list to a CSV file
    which can be opened and processed by your favorite spread sheet application. Each assignment is an own
    record (row) in the file. The values of each record are separated by commas.
1. `Start Date` and `Start Time` the start date and start time of edited Assignment.
1. `Set Start` pressing this button fills in the current date and time as start date and time in 
    the currently edited Assignement. 
1. `End Date` and `End Time` the end date, and the end time of the Assignment opened in the editor.
1. `Set End` pressing this button fills in the current date and time as end date and time in 
    the edited Assignment. 
1. `Project` the Project that is associated with the edited Assignment. A new Project is created
    in the selection list, as soon as the selection list loses its focus.
1. `Phase` the Phase that is associated with the edited Assignment. The list from which 
   the Phase can be selected depends on the selected Project.  A new Phase is created
   in the selection list, as soon as the selection list loses its focus.
1. `Task` the Task that is associated with the edited Assignment. The list from which 
    the Task can be selected depends on the selected Phase. A new Task is created
    in the selection list, as soon as the selection list loses its focus.
1. `Description` the detailed description of the edited Assignment.
1. `Clone Template Name` the template name of the Assignment. In case the template name is defined,
   the name may be specified when creating a new Assignment, see option (1.2) `Create Assignment by template`.
   In this case, the Project, Phase, and task, as well as the descrition of the template Assignment is filled 
   in the newly created Assignment.
1. `Save` saves the edited Assignment.
1. `Delete` Deletes a stored Assignment. This button is not available for newly created Assignments which have not 
    been saved yet.
1. `Cancel` Aborts the editing of an existing Assignment without storing any modified data.

`Note` Search criteria are connected by a logical `AND`. If a criterion is left empty, it is not taken 
into account for finding Assignments.

## Managing Projects/Phases/Tasks
The project management view consists of three sub-views:
- The Project view
- The Phase View
- The Task view

Basically, the Project management view allows to mange the Project meta data, i.e., to add, edit, and delete
Projects, Phases und Tasks.
